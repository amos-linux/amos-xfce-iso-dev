# amos-xfce-iso-git

With that github you can build your own amos-xfce-iso

If you need more software, and maybe a TWM like bspwm ,than there is NEMESIS in the .bin folder for you which will install nvidia ,a customised bspwm-desktop and lots of apps !

If you don't want to build the ISO yourself, you can download the iso also here :      https://drive.google.com/file/d/17KDGP9a-ebi2iaw_eb4IeAjN4kjDobb7/view?usp=sharing
